# Content

Security lab 1 is focused on providing a high level (but technical) introduction to security considerations

The core idea is that the users will be presented with a simple web page, that renders articles retrieved from an example backend and they are guided into discovering a series of vulnerabilities

# List of contents

- Webpages & traffic inspection
- Backend vs frontend
- HTTP Verbs, REST
- Login & JWT tokens
- Authorization header
- Frontend:
    - Any role based page restriction? Is it really working?
- Backend:
    - Risk of utilizing succesive IDs
    - Endpoints to retrieve articles, any vulnerability?
    - Endpoints to create & udpate articles, any vulnerability?
    - Endpoints to delete articles, any vulnerability?
- Closing words:
    - Injection, e.g. Is HTML injection possible?
    - Example of SQL injection (KAN-32)

# Pre-requisites

- Access to the test server machine
- Postman (App), Insomnia (Chrome extension) or Curl (Command line utility) are recommended but any alike tool will do
